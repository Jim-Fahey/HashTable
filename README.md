### Challenge 1
#### x % n where n is a large prime number, because it have no factors so there is a smaller chance that any given sum would have and equal output as another.
### Challenge 2
#### No, because there are many different combinations of letters that would equal the same sum, so you would have a lot of overlapping keys.
### Challenge 3
#### Key % n
### Challenge 4
#### The first file, HashTable, is a data storage type that Hashes the key and stores the value to whatever number comes from the hashed key. The second file driver runs the code and tests all methods to prove that they all work.
